title: Connecting new Bluetooth devices to the Sensor App
layout: redirect
---

The {{< sensor-app >}} connects to a range of Bluetooth sensor devices.
Additional devices will be added in the future.

To connect a device, click the plus button at the bottom right of the screen.
If Bluetooth is enabled and all required permissions are granted, your smartphone starts scanning for any new supported Bluetooth devices in the area that are not already paired.
New devices will be added to the list as the smartphone discovers them.

If there are no supported devices in range, there is an option to see a list of all currently supported device types.

Ensure that the device you wish to connect to is switched on and in pairing mode. For most devices, this automatically happens when they are switched on and not paired with any other device. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions if you are unsure.

Bring the device close to your smartphone, 30cm or less is ideal.

When the Bluetooth device appears in the list, tap **Pair Device** to start pairing. The Bluetooth device will then be connected to your smartphone and start sending data to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} if you are currently connected.
