For each device, detailed information is available. The kind of information actually provided for a device depends on the device type, device usage and the configuration of your user interface.

To view detailed information on the device, click a device in the device list.

![Device info](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-info.png)

The device details are divided into tabs. The number of tabs is dynamic and depends on the available information, that means, tabs are only displayed if the kind of information is available for the particular device. For a detailed description of the operations and fragments related to each device detail tab see the [Device management library](/reference/device-management-library/#overview) in the *Reference guide*.

Initially the **Info** tab is shown, which offers general information on a device and is available for each device.

Each device at least shows the following tabs: **Info**, **Alarms**, **Control**, **Events**, **Availability**, **Identity** (also see the tab list below).

The following tabs are the most common ones, each described in detail in a separate section:

</tbody>
</table>

<a name="location"></a>
### Location

The **Location** tab by default shows the location of a device on a map and as coordinates, as reported by the device. For devices that do not report a location you may manually set the location. Simply place the "pin" in the correct place of the displayed map.

![Location tab](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-location.png)

The **Location** tab also shows when a device contains `c8y_Position` property. When you send a new `c8y_Position` event, you can set the same `c8y_Position` fragment on the device and it will automatically mark its position on the map.


<a name="logs"></a>
### Logs

In the **Logs** tab you can manage log information from devices.

#### To request log information

1. In the **Logs** tab, click **Request log file** at the right of the top menu bar.
2. In the resulting dialog box, specify a date and time range for the log information.
3. Select the type of log from the dropdown field. The supported logs listed are usually device-specific.
4. Optionally, specify a text filter. For example, if you enter "Users", only lines including the term "Users" will appear in the returned log information.
5. Specify the maximum number of lines to be returned (counted from the end). The default value is 1000.
1. Click **Request log**.

The log information will be requested from the device.

![Logs tab](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-logs.png)

>Requesting a log from a device may take some time.

After the log has been transferred from the device to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, it will be listed in the **Logs** tab. The row in the list shows the requested log time range.

Click on the entry in the list to show the entire log information.

#### To download a log

Hover over a row and click the download icon, to download the log excerpt to your file system.

#### To delete a log

Hover over a row and click the delete icon, to delete the log information.

<a name="measurements"></a>
### Measurements

The **Measurements** tab provides a default visualization of numeric data provided by the device in the form of charts. Charts are grouped into types of measurements, which can contain multiple graphs or "series".

The screenshot below, for example, shows a chart for motion measurement including graphs for acceleration in the three dimensions, and a chart with modem statistics in the form of signal strength and bit error rate.

![Measurements](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-measurements.png)

If a chart contains graphs with different units, one Y-axis is rendered per unit. In the example above, motion measurements consist of three parameters with unit "meter per square second", so only one axis is rendered. Modem statistics consist of signal strength in decibel milliwatts and bit error rate in percent, so one axis is rendered for each graph.

To see detailed information about the measured values, hover over the chart. A tooltip will be displayed with detailed information on the measurement next to your cursor (the tooltip will "snap" to the closest measurement).

**Time range and aggregation**

By default, charts show the raw data of the last hour. To change the time range on the X-axis, open the "Last hour" dropdown menu at the top right and select a time range.

If you increase the time range, the value in the **Aggregation** field will automatically switch to "hourly" or "daily". The chart now shows ranges instead of individual raw data points. For "hourly", the chart will show a range of the minimum and maximum value measured in one hour. For "daily", the chart will show the minimum and maximum value measured over one day. Likewise, the tooltips will now show ranges of values instead of individual values.

This enables you to get an efficient overview over larger time periods. A graph will only show 5.000 data points per graph maximum to avoid overloading your desktop browser. If you select a fine focus resulting in more than 5.000 data points, a warning message will be shown: "Truncated data. Change aggregation or select shorter date range."

Clicking **Realtime** will enable real-time user interface updates of the graphs as new data flows into the system from the connected devices.

You can influence the graphical display and axes limits by setting up so-called "KPIs", see the [Administration Guide](/users-guide/administration).

**Measurement format**

In order to see measurement graphs, the device must send measurements in a specified fragment format.

	"fragment_name" : {
		"serie_name" : {
			"value" : ...
			"unit" : ...
		}
	}

Example:

	"c8y_SpeedMeasurement": {
	      "Speed": { "value": 1234, "unit": "km/h" }
	}

`"Fragment_name"` and `"serie_name"` can be replaced by different valid JSON property names, but no whitespaces and special characters like [ ],* are allowed. The structure must be exactly as above, two-level deep JSON object.

<a name="network"></a>
### Network

In the **Network** tab, mobile network (WAN) and local area network (LAN) parameters can be viewed and configured.

![Network tab](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-network.png)

The WAN parameters in the user interface correspond to the first profile stored in the router. These parameter can be configured remotely or via SMS.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
For SMS configuration, the router needs to be configured to accept SMS commands.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To configure WAN parameters

1. Enter the Access Point Name (APN).
2. Enter the username and the password of your account in the platform to which you wish to establish a connection.
3. Select the authentication type.
4. Click **Save changes** to save your settings.

#### To configure LAN parameters

To configure LAN parameters, simply enter **IP address** and **Subnet mask**.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
**Name** and **Mac address** fields are not configurable.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To configure DHCP parameters

1. Enter the address range in which the connection can be established.
2. Enter the DNS.
3. Enter the DNS 2.
4. Enter the domain name.
5. Click **Save changes** to save your settings.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If the LAN configuration is disabled, the DHCP configuration is automatically disabled as well.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

<a name="services"></a>
### Services

The **Services tab** provides a list of all services running on a device with their status, name, type and date of the last update.
Every column allows services to be filtered and/or sorted by the respective value displayed.

![Services overview](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-services-overview.png)

The platform defines three status options for services: **Up**, **Down** and **Unknown**.
These predefined statuses have their own graphical representation and can be selected directly from the **Status** filter:

![Status filter](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-services-status-filter.png)

Other status options are also allowed and can be freely defined, see [Service module](http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/modules/ServicesModule.html#readme) in the Web SDK documentation resources.
They all share the same icon and must be entered manually in the **Status** filter.
A tooltip on the status icon displays their actual value.

<a name="shell"></a>
### Shell

The device shell enables you to interactively work with remote devices. Many industrial devices support some form of command language, like AT commands for modems, CSV-style commands for many tracking devices or elaborate scripting mechanisms such as Tixi TiXML. In the shell, you can send commands in the respective language of the device and interactively view the results of the commands.

The **Shell** tab presents a command prompt to enter commands.

In the command prompt you can enter arbitrary command text. To send the command text to the device, click **Execute**. This button only is activated if the device is online.

![Device shell](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/devmgmt-devices-shell.png)

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
