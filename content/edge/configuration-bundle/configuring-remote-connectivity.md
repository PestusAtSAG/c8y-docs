The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant allows you to remotely manage your Edge appliance by registering the Edge appliance in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant account. To do so, you must first enable remote-connectivity in the Edge appliance and then register your Edge appliance in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant account. The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant uses the SSH protocol to access the remote Edge appliance through a web browser.

>**Important:** If you want to configure remote-connectivity, you must configure the DNS when configuring the network, for example, using the `/edge/configuration/network` endpoint.
