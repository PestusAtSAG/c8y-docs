{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge supports REST APIs to perform the tasks like installation, configuring the network for the Edge appliance, updating the Edge appliance, changing the hostname, and so on. The REST APIs in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge use the HTTPS protocol for all the endpoints. Before the installation, the self-signed certificate uses the currently configured IP address of the Edge appliance. You must use the IP address of the Edge appliance in the URL. For example, https://192.168.66.10/edge/tasks/latest-installation.

During the installation, the certificate changes from using the IP address to the domain name that you have configured. You must use the domain name in your browser to match the certificate. For example, https://myown.iot.com/edge/configuration/domain.

You can either upload a certificate (self-signed) issued by a certificate authority or have {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge generate a self-signed certificate for the domain name. Some of the endpoints could be temporarily unavailable during the installation. For example, the `edge/configuration/network` endpoint can be used only after the installation.

When you use a POST request, the server starts a task running in the background and returns a response with the ID of the task. You can use that ID to track the progress of the task. Here, the tasks refer to the installation process, uploading license and certificate files, configuring a network, etc. The immediate response indicates if the task is created successfully or not. To check the status of a task, use the `/edge/tasks/{id}` endpoint.

>**Important:** You cannot run two tasks at the same time. If you attempt to run a task when another task is in progress, then you will get a HTTP status 409.

### Authentication

If you are using the REST APIs for configuring the Edge appliance, most endpoints require authentication except `/edge/tasks/latest-installation` and `/edge/configuration/domain`. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge supports basic authentication and the authentication is performed by the {{< management-tenant >}}. For a successful authentication, you must prefix **management** to the username. The authorization header is formed as `Basic <Base64(<tenantID>/<c8yuser>:<password>)>`. For instance, if your tenantID, username and password are **management**, **admin** and **password** respectively, you can generate the Base64 string with the following command:

	$ echo -n management/admin:password | base64

Your authorization header would look like:

	Authorization: Basic bWFuYWdlbWVudC9hZG1pbjpwYXNzd29yZA==

The following table lists the endpoints that need authentication and the endpoints that does not need authentication:

|Endpoints does not need authentication|Endpoints need authentication
|:---|:---
|/edge/tasks/latest-installation|/edge/configuration/network
|/edge/configuration/domain|/edge/tasks/{id}
|/edge/install|/edge/tasks/{id}/log
||/edge/version
||/edge/configuration/hostname
||/edge/update
||/edge/configuration/time-sync
||/edge/configuration/microservices
||/edge/configuration/remote-connectivity
||/edge/reboot
||/edge/configuration/certificate
||/edge/expand-disk

### GET /edge/tasks/latest-installation

Use this endpoint to get the information about the latest installation of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge.

**Response**

The endpoint returns:

- HTTP status 200, if an attempt has been made to perform the installation.

		{
			"id":"4",
			"type":"installation",
			"status":"succeeded"
		}

	The `status` represents the current status of the installation: `executing`, `succeeded`, or `failed`.

- HTTP status 404, before an installation has been attempted.

### GET /edge/configuration/domain

Use this endpoint to get the domain name configured in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge. This endpoint is available only after a successful installation.

**Response**:

The endpoint returns:

- HTTP status 200, after the installation.

		{
			"domain_name":"myown.iot.com"
			"licensed_domain_name": "myown.iot.com"
		}

  Here, the `domain_name` specifies the domain name that is configured. The `licensed_domain_name` specifies the domain name that is attached to the license.

### POST /edge/install

Use this endpoint to perform the initial installation.

If the installation is successful, this endpoint will not be available.

If the installation fails, this endpoint will be available. You can use the endpoint to attempt the installation again.

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Content-Type|application/json

**Request**

```http
POST https://192.168.66.10/edge/install
Content-Type: application/json

	{
		"admin": {"username": "admin", "password": "Edge1!23"},
		"root_password": "Edge4!56",
		"edge_admin": {"username": "admin", "password": "Edge7!89", "email": "username@iot.com"},
		"domain_name": "myown.iot.com",
		"certificate": "upload"                            
	}
```

In the JSON format above, the value of `certificate` can be `generate` or `upload`:

- If you have set `"certificate": "generate"`, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge generates the certificate for you.

- If you have set `"certificate": "upload"`, you must upload the certificate, before the installation will start.

**Response**

The endpoint returns:

- HTTP status 201, if the request is successful.


		{
		  "id":"1",
		  "uploads":[
			{"name":"licence","url":"https://192.168.66.10/edge/upload/1/licence"},
			{"name":"certificate","url":"https://192.168.66.10/edge/upload/1/certificate"},
			{"name":"certificate_key","url":"https://192.168.66.10/edge/upload/1/certificate_key"}
		 ]
		}

	If you have set `"certificate": "generate"`, the `uploads` array contains only the `licence` entry.

Note that this task does not start the installation. You must run subsequent calls to upload the license and the certificate files to start the installation.

To upload the license and the certificate files, use the URLs returned in the JSON response. The `upload_key` represents the values of the keys: `license`, `certificate`, and `certificate_key`. For more information, see [Uploading files using REST APIs](/edge/rest-api/#uploading-files-using-rest-api).

The `id` returned in the JSON response is the task ID. Use the task ID for polling the task. See [GET /edge/tasks/{id}](/edge/rest-api/#get-edgetasksid).

### POST /edge/configuration/domain

Use this endpoint to change the domain name.

During the process of changing the domain name, the certificate presented by the REST endpoints is changed from the certificate for the old domain to the certificate for the new domain. Polling using HTTPS to the old domain will make a secure connection until the certificate is updated to the new domain. After the certificate is updated, polling using HTTPS to the old domain will fail to make a secure connection and you should switch to polling using HTTPS to the new domain.

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Content-Type|application/json

**Request**

```http
POST https://myown.iot.com/edge/configuration/domain
Content-Type: application/json

	{
    "domain_name": "new.domain.com",
    "certificate": "upload"
	}
```
In the JSON format above, the value of `certificate` can be `generate` or `upload`.

If the existing SSL certificate is compatible with the new domain name, you do not have to upload a new certificate nor will {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge generate one regardless of what you set as the value of `certificate`.

**Response**

The endpoint returns:

- HTTP status 201, if the request is successful.


		{
		  "id":"1",
		  "uploads":[
			{"name":"licence","url":"https://myown.iot.com/edge/upload/4/licence"},
			{"name":"certificate","url":"https://myown.iot.com/edge/upload/4/certificate"},
			{"name":"certificate_key","url":"https://myown.iot.com/edge/upload/4/certificate_key"}
		 ]
		}

	If the new domain name is compatible with the existing license, the `uploads` array will not contain the `licence` entry.

	If the new domain name is compatible with the existing certificate, the `uploads` array will not contain the `certificate` and `certificate_key` entries.

	The task starts immediately and can be polled if there are no uploads. For example, the response would not have an `uploads` key:

		{
			"id":"1"
		}

You must run subsequent calls to upload the license and the certificate files to change the domain name if the `uploads` array requires you to upload.

To upload the license and the certificate files, use the URLs returned in the JSON response. For more information, see [Uploading files using REST APIs](/edge/rest-api/#uploading-files-using-rest-api).

The `id` returned in the JSON response is the task ID. Use the task ID for polling the task. See [GET /edge/tasks/{id}](/edge/rest-api/#get-edgetasksid).

### POST /edge/update

Use this endpoint to update {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge to a newer version.

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|

POST https://myown.iot.com/edge/update
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "type": "upload"
}
```
**Response**

The endpoint returns HTTP status 201, if the request is successful.

```json
{
    "id": "5",
    "uploads": [
        {
            "name": "archive",
            "url": "https://myown.iot.com/edge/upload/5/archive"
        }
    ]
}
```

Upload the archive of the new {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge version using the URL returned in the JSON response. For more information, see [Uploading files using REST APIs](/edge/rest-api/#uploading-files-using-rest-api).

The `id` returned in the JSON response is the task ID. Use the task ID for polling the task. See [GET /edge/tasks/{id}](/edge/rest-api/#get-edgetasksid).

### POST /edge/configuration/network

Use this endpoint to configure the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge network.

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Content-Type|application/json

>**Important:** Do not use the IP addresses 10.244.0.0 and 10.96.0.0 in your network configuration. These IP addresses are reserved for {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge internal purpose.

**Request**

```http
POST https://192.168.66.10/edge/configuration/network
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"address": "192.168.66.10",

	"gateway": "192.168.66.1",
	"dns": "8.8.8.8"
}
```
Use the above JSON format before the installation to configure the network.

>**Important:** For DNS, do not use the IP addresses 10.96.0.10 and 127.0.0.1.

After the installation, you can configure the IP range for network CIDR using the same JSON format with an additional key `ip_range`:

**Request**

```http
POST https://192.168.66.10/edge/configuration/network
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"address": "192.168.66.10",
	"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
	"gateway": "192.168.66.1",
	"dns": "8.8.8.8",
	"ip_range": "172.18.0.1/16"
}
```
Here, the `ip_range` is an IPv4 CIDR. The CIDR suffix must be between 0 and 27 inclusive. The default value for `ip_range` is 172.16.0.0/15.

The **ip_range** must not overlap with the reserved IP addresses. See [Reserved IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses).

Before the installation, the `dns` and the network CIDR keys are optional.

>**Info:** If the IP address of the Edge appliance overlaps with the Edge appliance's `ip_range`, then you must update the `ip_range`.

**Response**

The endpoint returns HTTP status 201, if the request is successful.

```json
