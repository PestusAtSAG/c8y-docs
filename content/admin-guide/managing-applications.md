In the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform we distinguish between two kinds of applications:

* [Subscribed applications](#subscribed-applications) -  all applications subscribed to the tenant (either provided by the platform or a service provider) but not owned. May not be added, modified or removed by the user.
* [Own applications](#own-applications) - all applications owned by the tenant. Users can [add custom applications](#adding-applications) in various ways as own applications.
