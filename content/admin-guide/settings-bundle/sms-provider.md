SMS are used throughout the platform for various features like [two-factor authentication](/users-guide/administration#tfa) and user notifications, i.e. on alarms.

By providing your credentials you enable platform features that utilize SMS services.

### To enter SMS provider credentials

1. Click **SMS provider** in the **Settings** menu.

2. In the **SMS provider** page, select one of the available SMS providers from the **SMS provider** dropdown field. You can start typing to filter items and more easily find your preferred provider.

3. In the resulting dialog, enter the required credentials and properties or specify optional settings, which differ depending on the provider you selected.

4. Click **Save** to save your settings.

>**Info:** OpenIT does not serve new customers anymore and is in the process of shutting down their SMS provider business. We therefore recommend you to select one of the other SMS providers.
