EPL apps are designed to listen for REST (Representational State Transfer) services and supports all GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations. Example requests for the different operations are listed below.

To perform these operations, you must have READ and ADMIN permissions for "CEP management" (see also [Administration > Managing permissions](/users-guide/administration/#managing-permissions) in the *User guide*).

> **Info**: This API requires version 10.6.0 or above of the Apama-ctrl microservice.

### Request headers for all operations

Each request must be authenticated to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

| Name   | Description                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Accept | "application/json". This is a mandatory parameter. |

### Common response codes

The following common error response codes can be expected for all requests:

| Code | Description                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| 403  | Forbidden. EPL apps are not available with Apama Starter. |

Any other response codes that can be expected from a specific request are given below.

### Common field descriptions

The following common fields are available with the responses, depending on the operation:

### POST - Create a new EPL application

Endpoint: `/service/cep/eplfiles`

#### Example request

`POST /service/cep/eplfiles`

The following is an example of a request body:

```

  "contents": "monitor M1 { action onload() { on wait(1.0) { log \"Hello\" at INFO; }}}",
  "state": "active",
  "description": ""
}
```

Note the following:

- The `name` is used for the package of the file (thus the EPL file must not contain a `package` statement) and must be unique across all EPL files. The name is prefixed and certain characters are escaped. The actual package name used is returned in the `eplPackageName` field for convenience (you can search for this in the microservice log file to find log statements).
- Make sure to provide safely escaped `contents`.
- `description` is optional and can be empty.
