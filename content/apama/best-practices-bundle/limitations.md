title: Apama limitations in Cumulocity IoT

---

Using Apama within the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} environment necessarily has some restrictions to the capabilities available when Apama is used standalone.

There are a number of ways that assets may be deployed to Apama within {{< product-c8y-iot >}} and the restrictions vary according to those mechanisms:

* EPL apps - the simplest mechanism to deploy Apama assets into a fully managed Apama correlator, see [Basic functionality > Deploying apps](/apama/analytics-introduction/#deploying-apps).
* Custom microservice – where more complex Apama projects can be built using {{< product-c8y-iot >}}'s Microservice SDK, see [Developing applications > Microservices](/concepts/applications#microservices) in the *Concepts guide*.

When designing an Apama solution to be deployed within any form of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} environment, consider the following points.

### General Apama limitations when using EPL apps or a custom microservice

* For scalability, a correlator may move between hosts and therefore does not have access to a persistent file system. It is a standard {{< product-c8y-iot >}} constraint that all microservices (either provided by the platform, or custom) must be stateless – see [Developing applications > Microservices](/concepts/applications#microservices) in the *Concepts guide*.

	The Apama features affected by this include:

	* Correlator persistence.
	* MemoryStore persistence.

* Non-HTTP/REST connections to an external system or process are mostly impractical. Although if a service is available over the internet, then it can be used (for example, an HTTP client inside Apama could connect to publicly accessible HTTP servers).

	The Apama features affected by this include:

	* Apama Database Connector (ADBC).
	* Correlator-integrated support for the Java Message Service (JMS).
	* Software AG Digital Event Services.
	* Distributed memory stores.
	* Connections between correlators.

* For security and implementing user access control, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} does not make the correlator port available to external processes – see [Developing applications > Microservices](/concepts/applications#microservices) in the *Concepts guide*.

	The following capabilities require access to the correlator port and hence are not compatible with this access control:

	* Command line tools such as engine_connect, engine_management, engine_send, engine_receive.
	* Engine Management API, Event Service API, Scenario Service API.
	* Connecting to adapters running out-of-process in an IAF.
	* Dashboards (provided in-the-box with Apama).
	* Debugging from {{< sag-designer >}}. Instead, debug your app running in a local correlator.
	* Correlator REST interface.

* To reduce both the memory usage of an application during startup and the application's startup time,
  ensure the application is completely initialized before injecting monitors that automatically unload, 
  and before running time-consuming queries.

### Specific Apama limitations when using EPL apps

* For ease of use, the correlator startup is controlled by {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. Thus, features that require you to change configuration files or command line options are not accessible.

	The Apama features affected by this include:

	* Persistence.
	* Connectivity plug-ins.
	* Management via Command Central.

* For security, the file system used by the correlator is not accessible.

	The Apama features affected by this include:

	* Accessing the input log.
	* Using custom plug-ins.
	* Using file system assets for enrichment.

* For simplicity, it is only possible to make independent EPL injections. Each monitor is managed independently and so dependencies between different monitors cannot be created.

	The Apama features affected by this include:

	* A \*.mon file must not contain a package statement (to do so is an error).
	* It is not possible to share event definitions between separate \*.mon files.
	* It is not possible to use Apama queries.
	* You can only use the bundles listed in [Developing apps with {{< sag-designer >}}](/apama/analytics-introduction/#sag-designer).

All of these restrictions are implemented to ensure the smooth and secure operation of EPL apps within {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.
