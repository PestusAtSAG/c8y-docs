You access the Streaming Analytics application using the [application switcher](/users-guide/getting-started/#app-switcher).

![Streaming Analytics home screen](/images/apama/streaming-analytics-home-screen.png)

The home screen of the Streaming Analytics application lets you navigate to the different pages of the application. 
These are [Analytics Builder](#analytics-builder) and [EPL Apps](#apama-epl-apps). 
You can access these pages using the corresponding **Open** button on the home screen or by using the navigator on the left.

If you need more space for a page, you can hide the navigator. Click the small arrow at the very left of the top bar to toggle the display of the navigator.

The home screen also provides information on smart rules. You create and maintain them with the Cockpit application.
See [Cockpit > Smart rules](/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules) in the *User guide* for detailed information.

The home screen and navigator only show entries for the items that you are allowed to use, 
depending on the version of the Apama-ctrl microservice to which your tenant is subscribed. 
See also [Microservice runtime and applications](#microservice-and-applications) and 
[Customizing the home screen of the Streaming Analytics application](/apama/advanced/#customize-home-screen).
