<td> On the <b>Software</b> tab, the <b>Installed software</b> view displays a <b>Filter by software type</b> dropdown box allowing the software list to be filtered by the type of the software object. In the list, if a software object has a software type defined it is displayed as a label next to its name. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td> The <b>Service monitoring</b> tab in the device details view and the <b>Service monitoring</b> overview page, which both display information about device availability derived from the number of critical alarms raised and cleared during a given time period, have both been renamed to <b>Availability</b>. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td> In the <b>Install software</b> dialog, showing up on the <b>Software</b> tab of the device details view, you can search through software and select one for installation. Until now users could only filter by name. Now you can also filter by software type. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td> In the <b>Install software</b> dialog on the <b>Software</b> tab of the device details view, if the device supports software types, the only software objects shown in the installation dialog will be those matching the defined software types for this device. </td>

OPC UA</td>
<td> To achieve higher security, the encryption method for the private key, which is used in the opcua-device-gateway to identify the application, has been changed. As a result, running previous versions of the opcua-device-gateway is no longer supported. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> Fixed an issue where the UI was unresponsive after some measurement types had been deleted but were still considered as supported by the device, until the removal of the event had been fully processed by the server-side application. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td> The layout of the <b>Logs</b> tab in the device details view has been improved, including icons and list styling. </td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M post-registration operations are delivered for execution via the real-time channel. If the device is not internally subscribed yet, then the pending operations will now also be internally fetched by another process for execution. </td>
<td>
MTM-42865</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> When the protocol resource type is configured as a string it is not possible to receive numeric values which are expected to be processed as numeric data. The LWM2M agent only reads the data and logs a "Measurement creation is skipped for non-numeric value mapping:" message and creates an alarm. The values are not processed, because the agent doesn't expect the measurement as a string but only Boolean, integer or float.
<br>
This issue is now resolved. The agent accepts numeric (integer and float) values sent as a string. In addition also the following strings will be treated as  numeric values:
<br>- Any positive or negative numeric sequence with leading 0 (zero) will be interpreted as octal value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br>- Any positive or negative alphanumeric sequence containing letters from A to F, starting with 0x will be interpreted as hex value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br>
Strings which do not meet these requirement won't be processed and an error message will be logged. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-14-0 >}}/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#overview" class="no-ajaxy">LWM2M > Overview</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent operation handler now handles a Californium library's connector error by setting the operation back to pending state to process the operation later on. This kind of error can happen when sending an operation to a device and there is no longer a DTLS connection with the URI that is used. </td>
<td>
MTM-43663</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> In the custom actions of the device protocols details, LWM2M now only returns decoder microservices which are subscribed to the current tenant. Prior to this change, decoder microservices not subscribed to the tenant were shown as well. </td>
