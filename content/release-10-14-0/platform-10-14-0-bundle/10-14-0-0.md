<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>

<td>
MQTT</td>
<td> Additional MQTT static templates have been added: "SR template to set fragment hashcode" (130), "SR template to read fragment hashcode" (131) and "SR response template with fragment hashcode" (132). </td>

<tr>
<td>
 Realtime </td>
<td> The "hello-world notification microservice", which serves as an example of the new Notifications 2.0 functionality, lacked a detailed user description. New instructions have been added that provide step-by-step setup, even for a first time user. A new script to simplify the setup process has been added as well, which helps in setting up a measurement device and simulate sending measurements.
See <a href="https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/hello-world-notification-microservice" class="no-ajaxy">https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/hello-world-notification-microservice</a> for full details and instructions. </td>
<td>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td>If a user adds the query parameter `withTotalElements` to a request, a new field called `totalElements` will be returned.
This change is available on almost all REST APIs. The `withTotalElements` field contains the amount of all documents that this API can return. </td>

<td>
Administration</td>
<td> In the <b>Applications</b> page it is now possible to delete the current application if a subscribed application with the same context-path exists.

<td>
Core platform</td>
<td> Responses to the HEAD/GET requests to the file repository now return a Content-Length header which lets the requesting clients know the size of the files before downloading them. This makes the progress bar in the file repository more reliable. </td>
