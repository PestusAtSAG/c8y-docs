The following steps describe how to set up an offloading pipeline.

#### Defining an offloading configuration

To define an offloading configuration, click **Offload collection** to start a wizard which guides you through the main steps:

* [Select collection](#select-collection)
* [Configure target table](#configure-target-table)
* [Set additional result columns](#set-addtl-cols)
* [Set filter predicate](#set-filter-predicate)
* [Configure task](#configure-task)
* [Configure additional settings and complete configuration](#finish)

The wizard prepopulates settings for the different steps to ease the configuration process. You can modify those settings according to your needs.

<a name="select-collection"></a>
##### Select collection

In the dropdown box select one of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collections, which are:

* alarms
* events
* inventory
* measurements

> **Info:** You can define multiple offloading pipelines for each {{< product-c8y-iot >}} collection, except for the case of a TrendMiner offloading configuration, which must be singleton. As an example for multiple pipelines, you can filter the alarms collection by different criteria with each one resulting in a separate pipeline.

In the section [Offloading {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collections](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#offloading-base-collections) you will find a summary of the default attributes being offloaded per base collection.

<img src="/images/datahub-guide/datahub-define-an-offloading-task.png" alt="Define an offloading task" style="max-width: 100%">

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

<a name="configure-target-table"></a>
##### Configure target table

Once you have selected a collection for offloading, you must specify the target table in the data lake. The **Target table name** denotes the folder name in the data lake. In this folder the offloaded data will be stored. In Dremio a table is created with the same name, pointing to this data lake folder. This table is used when querying the corresponding data lake folder and thus the offloaded data. The target table name must follow these syntax rules:

* It needs to start with an alphanumeric character (letters and numbers).
* It may contain alphanumeric characters, underscores (_) and dashes (-).
* Each underscore or dash must be preceded by an alphanumeric character.
* The name must be at least two characters long.

Each pipeline must have its own target table in the data lake, that is, you must select distinct target table names for each offloading configuration.

For **alarms**, **events**, **inventory** collection, you only need to specify the target table name in this step.

For the **measurements** collection, additional settings are required. The **target table layout** refers to the way the measurements are stored. Measurements in the base collection may have different types, for example, the collection may contain temperature, humidity, and pressure measurements. Depending on your layout choice, measurements are stored differently in the target table.

The layout **One table for one measurement type (Default)** creates a table containing only measurements of one specific type; measurements of other types are not included. When selecting this layout, you must additionally specify the **measurement type** to which the offloaded measurements are restricted. To identify existing measurement types, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub automatically inspects a subset of the data, including initial as well as latest data. In the measurement type dropdown box, these auto-detected types are listed. If a specific type you are looking for has not been detected, you can manually enter it in this box. Alternatively you can click the popover next to the measurement types and select **Refresh** to manually re-trigger the detection of measurement types. As this might be a performance-intensive process, you should trigger it only if you know that the expected measurement type is present in data recently inserted into the collection. You can trigger such a refresh only every five minutes for performance reasons.  

The layout **All measurement types in one table (TrendMiner)** creates a table containing measurements of all types. To distinguish the measurements, the table has a column which lists for each measurement its corresponding type. The specific table schema for this layout is listed later in the section [Offloading {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collections](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#offloading-base-collections). This layout is only for use cases where you want to offload the data into the data lake, so that TrendMiner can consume the data for its time-series analytics. When this layout is selected, the target table name is set to a fixed, non-editable name, which TrendMiner expects for its data import. To learn more about the interaction between TrendMiner and {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub, see [Integrating {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub with TrendMiner](/datahub/integrating-datahub-with-sag-products/#integration-trendminer).

For each base collection, a default set of data fields is derived. This set defines the default schema of the target table with the columns capturing the data fields. The set is fix for each collection and cannot be modified. Select **Show default schema** to show the columns of the default schema with their corresponding name and type.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Finish** to jump directly to the final step. Both steps will fail if the associated base collection is empty, as it prevents necessary schema investigations. In such a case you must ensure that the base collection is not empty before you can proceed with the offloading configuration. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

<a name="set-addtl-cols"></a>
##### Set additional result columns

If you have added additional top-level fields while feeding data into {{< product-c8y-iot >}} and you want to access them in your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub queries, then you can include them as additional result columns. You can also use additional result columns to offload data fields in the base collection which are not part of the default schema. Additional result columns can be configured optionally. The TrendMiner case does not support this option.

**Auto-detected columns**

To ease the configuration process, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub auto-detects additional result columns. Using a sample of the base collection, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub searches for additional top-level fields and provides them as additional result columns. You can either include such an auto-detected column in your offloading or not. As the auto-detection logic relies on a sample, not all additional top-level fields might be captured. You can manually add a column to include a field you miss.

**Structure of additional result columns**

Each additional result column, whether it is manually configured or auto-detected, has the following properties:

- **Selected**: With this checkbox, you define if the column is included in the offloading pipeline or not.
- **Column name**: The column name is the name the column will have in the target table. The column name must be unique.
- **Auto-detected**: This property denotes whether the column has been auto-detected or manually added by the user.
- **Source definition**: The source definition is the actual SQL expression, which defines what the data in this column looks like.
- **Column type**: The column type defines which kind of data the column contains, for example, DOUBLE for double values or VARCHAR for strings.

When entering the configuration step for additional result columns, all columns and their properties are shown in a table, with one additional result column per row. At the top right the **Hide auto-detected columns** checkbox allows you to either show the auto-detected columns or not. On the right side of each additional result column, a collapse button and a context menu is available. With the collapse button you can expand/collapse more details of the column. In the details section you can explore the source definition as well as sample data of the column. In the context menu of an additional result column you find actions for editing, duplicating, or deleting the column. The column name can also be edited inline by clicking into the name field, adapting the name, and clicking once outside the field.

At the top right of the table you find a button for manually adding an additional result column.

If you enter the additional result columns step for a running offloading pipeline, that is, the pipeline is scheduled, you cannot modify the columns.

**Add an additional result column**

When adding an additional result column, a dialog box for defining the column opens. You must define a unique column name. Then the source definition needs to be specified. You can validate the source definition and preview its results by clicking **Validate and preview**.

First step is to define a field from the base collection in the source definition. Then you can optionally apply SQL functions to adapt the data of this field to your needs, for example, by trimming whitespace or rounding decimal values. The source definition editor supports you in this process with content completion and syntax highlighting.

If you want to derive additional result columns from nested content, you can specify the nested fields using the prefix "src." and the path to the nested field. For example, if you have a top-level field "someField" with a nested field "someSubField", add "src.someField.someSubField" as additional result column. In the same way you can access nested arrays. If you have a top-level field "someField" with a nested array field "someArraySubField", add "src.someField.someArraySubField[0]" as additional result column to access the first array entry.

<img src="/images/datahub-guide/datahub-add-addtl-col.png" alt="Add additional result column" style="max-width: 40%">

Click **Apply** to add the column, which will be selected for offloading by default. If the source definition is invalid, for example when accessing an unknown column, you get an error message like *Column "UnknownColumn" not found in any table*. You must fix the source definition before you can proceed. Click **Cancel** to cancel the configuration of the additional result column.

**Edit an additional result column**

In the context menu of an additional result column, select **Edit** to open the dialog for editing the column name and the source definition. Click **Apply** to update the column with the new settings. The new column name must be unique and the source definition must be valid in order to proceed. Click **Cancel** to quit editing the column.

Note that for auto-detected columns the source definition cannot be modified. If you want to modify the source definition, you must duplicate the auto-detected column.

**Duplicate an additional result column**

In the context menu of an additional result column, select **Duplicate** to open the dialog for duplicating the column. The source definition of the duplicate column is the same as of the original column and can be adapted to your needs. The column name uses the original column name plus a counter as suffix to make the name unique. You can adapt the name to your needs, provided the name is unique.

Click **Apply** to complete and **Cancel** to quit duplicating the column.

**Delete an additional result column**

In the context menu of an additional result column, select **Delete** to open the dialog for deleting the column. Click **Confirm** to proceed or **Cancel** to cancel the deletion.

Auto-detected columns cannot be deleted.

When deleting an additional result column, the data will no longer be included in the next offloading run. Data which has already been offloaded to the data lake is not affected by the deletion of the column.  

**Migration of additional result columns**

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub versions prior to version 10.10 offer a single text field for defining a comma-separated list of additional result columns. Offloading configurations defined with such an old version internally rely on a different format for managing additional result columns. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub version 10.10 and above includes an auto-migration procedure in its version upgrade process to automatically migrate an old configuration to the new additional result columns format. In rare cases this auto-migration might fail, for example, when the SQL expression is invalid. Such a configuration can still be scheduled, but its settings cannot be modified.

To migrate to the new format manually, proceed as follows:

1. In the context menu of the column click **Show** and navigate through the configuration.
2. Copy the task name, the additional result columns definition, and the target table name to a text editor.
3. Create a new configuration with an arbitrary target table name and an arbitrary task name.
4. Navigate to the additional result columns step. Rebuild the additional result columns by manually adding the same columns as given in the old definition. For example, the expression "'Hello' AS Col1, 'World' AS Col2" results in two columns, one with name "Col1" and source definition "'Hello'" and one with name "Col2" and source definition "'World'". In case columns in the old definition were not named, Dremio has automatically assigned a column name like "EXPR$1". Use the preview of the old configuration to get the corresponding column names and use them when defining the new additional result columns. Complete the configuration.
5. Delete the old configuration.
6. Edit the new configuration and set the task name and the target table name of the old configuration.
7. When activating the new configuration, you are prompted for either flushing or appending to the existing data. Use the latter option to base the new configuration on the data the old configuration has offloaded so far.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

<a name="set-filter-predicate"></a>
##### Set filter predicate

Optionally you can define an additional filter predicate. Per default, all entries in the base collection are offloaded to the data lake; you can use the predicate to filter out entries you do not want to persist in the data lake. For example, you can filter out invalid values or outliers. In the **Additional filter predicate** field, you can specify such a filter in SQL syntax. For example, for the alarms collection the filter might be "status='ACTIVE' AND severity='WARNING'" to only persist active alarms with a severe warning. The filter predicate functionality supports complex SQL statements, that is, a combination of AND/OR, clauses like "IN(...)" / "NOT IN(...)", and functions such as "REGEXP_LIKE(text, 'MyText\S+')".

In the filter predicate you can query all standard attributes of the base collection as well as the custom fields. The additional result columns defined in the previous configuration step cannot be accessed by their name in the filter predicate. You must use the source definition as defined in the corresponding column instead.

> **Info:** For querying the attribute "id", you must use "&#95;id". For querying the time attributes, see also [Working with {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub > {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub best practices](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#datahub-best-practices) for example snippets of widely-used temporal filter predicates.

When defining an additional filter predicate, you can click **Validate** to validate your predicate. If the validation fails, you will get an error description. For example, if you want to apply the trim function to a numeric value "TRIM(numeric_value)", you get an error message that the trim function cannot be applied in that case. You must fix these errors before you can proceed.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

<a name="configure-task"></a>
##### Configure task

The task configuration step includes the offloading task name and the description. The **Offloading task name** is an identifier for the offloading pipeline. It must have at minimum one non-whitespace character. Even though the task name does not have to be unique, it is advisable to use a unique name.

In the **Description** field, you can add a description for this offloading pipeline. The description is optional, but we recommend you to use it, as it provides additional information about the pipeline and its purpose.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

<a name="finish"></a>
##### Configure additional settings and complete configuration

The final step provides a summary of your settings, the configuration of additional settings, and a result preview. The summary includes the settings from the previous steps as well as the internal UUID of this configuration. The UUID is generated by the system and cannot be modified. With the UUID you can distinguish configurations having the same task name, for example, when browsing the audit log or the offloading status. In the summary, you also get the schedule with which the offloading pipeline will be executed once it is started, for example, "every hour at minute 6". The schedule cannot be modified. With the **Inactive**/**Active** toggle at the end of the summary you select whether the periodic offloading execution should be activated upon save or not.  

In the offloading preview you can inspect what the actual data that will be offloaded looks like. For this purpose, an offloading preview is executed, returning a sample of the resulting data. The header row of the sample data incorporates the column name as well as the column type. Use **Hide time columns** to either show the default columns with a temporal notion or not. Note that no data is persisted to the data lake when running the preview.

**Compaction strategy**

In the additional settings, you can define the compaction strategy for the offloading pipeline. The compaction strategy refers to how {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub automatically combines multiple smaller files in the data lake into one or more larger files. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub periodically executes the compaction for an offloading pipeline as a large number of small files may adversely affect the query performance. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub automatically sets the compaction strategy, but allows you to optionally change the strategy. Available compaction strategies are:

- **Monthly & daily compaction:** {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub selects for each day all files in the data lake which contain data from that day. These files will be combined into one or more larger files containing all data for this day. Additionally, all days for one month are combined into one or more larger files containing all data for this month. This results in summary files for each day and for each month, while the original files are deleted.
- **Daily compaction:** {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub selects for each day all files in the data lake which contain data from that day. These files will be combined into one or more larger files containing all data for this day. This results in summary files for each day, while the original files are deleted.
- **No compaction:** Compaction is disabled. This setting is not recommended and must be used with caution as it has most likely negative impact on the query performance.

You can change the compaction strategy of an already running offloading pipeline by deactivating the pipeline, editing it, and reactivating it. If a compaction was already executed in the past, disabling the compaction strategy does not revert the previous compaction results.

**View materialization**

In the additional settings, you can enable/disable view materialization for an offloading pipeline based on the alarms, events, or inventory collection. For these three collections, additional views over the target table are defined in the tenant’s space in Dremio. The *_latest* view maintains the latest status of all entities, excluding intermediate transitions of an entity. For large tables, the maintenance of the view might adversely affect overall performance. For that reason, the *_latest* view can be materialized so that the latest state of each entity will be persisted in the data lake. If that setting is activated for a pipeline, the materialized view will be created with the next offloading run and updated for each subsequent run. The materialized view is named with suffix *_c8y_cdh_latest_materialized*. If you deactivate the setting for a pipeline, the view is still available, but no more materialized.

> **Info:** When view materialization is activated, additional data is stored in the data lake, which might affect your storage costs.

Finally, click **Save** to save the offloading pipeline. Otherwise click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration. You can also navigate back to adapt previous settings, using the **Previous** buttons.
