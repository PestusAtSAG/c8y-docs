{{< company-c8y >}} offers a wide range of functionality for interfacing IoT devices and other IoT-related data sources with the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform.

This Device SDK guide provides detailed information on device integration using [MQTT](/device-sdk/mqtt), [REST](/device-sdk/rest) and [C++](/device-sdk/cpp).

For interfacing devices with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, we recommend you to use MQTT and [SmartREST](/reference/smartrest/), which can be very efficiently implemented using available MQTT client libraries such as [Eclipse Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/).

An up-to-date open source reference implementation of a {{< product-c8y-iot >}} agent for embedded Linux systems with many device management features can be found at [https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-agents-linux](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-agents-linux). Note that the reference implementation currently uses SmartREST 1 with the choice to switch between HTTP and MQTT as transport protocol.

For information on the general concept of agents being used for interfacing IoT data sources with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, refer to [Interfacing devices](/concepts/interfacing-devices) in the *Concepts guide*.
