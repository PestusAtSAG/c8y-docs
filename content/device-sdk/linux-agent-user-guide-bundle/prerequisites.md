### Required and optional packages

- Required packages
  - A C++11-standard-compliant compiler
  - liblua (>= 5.1)
  - libcurl (>=7.57.0)<br><br>
- Optional packages
  - systemd (for auto-start of the agent on boot)
  - libmodbus (>= 3.0.8), for the use of Modbus only
  - lua-socket (>=3.0), for the use of CANopen only

The packages can be installed with the following commands in the terminal window on Ubuntu 18.04:

```shell
# compiler
sudo apt install build-essential
# required
sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev
# optional for Modbus
sudo apt install libmodbus-dev lua-socket
# optional for CANopen
sudo apt install lua-socket
```

> **Info:** The following steps have been tested for Ubuntu 18.04, but should work with other distributions as well.

Make sure that the following libraries (-dev version) are installed.

- libcurl >= 7.57.0
- lua >= 5.1

Confirm that the libraries are installed by using the `apt` command (should show something like libcurl4-gnutls-dev or liblua5.3-dev).

```shell
apt list --installed | grep libcurl
apt list --installed | grep lua
```

In case they are not installed in your environment, search for the libraries' packages.

```shell
apt-cache search libcurl | grep dev
apt-cache search liblua | grep dev
```

Then, install the proper libraries. For example:

```shell
sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev
```

### Building the C++ SDK

The agent software requires the [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} C++ SDK](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-sdk-c), so you need to build the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} C++ SDK first, before starting to build the software.


1. Launch a Git client and clone the SDK repository to a directory of your choice. For example:

    ```shell
    cd ~/<my_working_directory>
    git clone https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-sdk-c.git
    ```

2. Enter the directory and pull in all submodule dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd cumulocity-sdk-c
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

3. In the _cumulocity-sdk-c_ directory, create an _init.mk_ file by copying the _common.mk_ file.

    ```shell
    cp common.mk init.mk
    ```

    Also, create a custom _Makefile_ file by copying _Makefile.template_.

    ```shell
    cp Makefile.template Makefile
    ```

4. Modify your _init.mk_ file with the proper library name on the `CPPFLAGS` and `LDLIBS` line. If you installed the liblua5.3-dev library then modify from:

    ```shell
    CPPFLAGS:=$(shell pkg-config --cflags libcurl lua)
    CXXFLAGS:=-Wall -pedantic -Wextra
    LDLIBS:=$(shell pkg-config --libs libcurl lua)
    ```

    to:

    ```shell
    CPPFLAGS:=$(shell pkg-config --cflags libcurl lua5.3)
    CXXFLAGS:=-Wall -pedantic -Wextra
    LDLIBS:=$(shell pkg-config --libs libcurl lua5.3)
    ```

    > **Info:**  This step is required for the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Raspbian distributions. However, this step must be skipped for the CentOS 7 distribution. If you use other operating systems, run `pkg-config --cflags lua` and `pkg-config --libs lua` and confirm that no errors are returned.

    If you don't know which liblua version has already been installed on your device, you can find the version which you need to add to your _init.mk_ by:

    ```shell
    ldconfig -p | grep lua
    ```

    It will return a name like "liblua**5.3**.so.0", so you can assume that lua5.3 should be added.

5. To build the SDK in debug mode, run:

    ```shell
    make
    ```

    For production, to build in release mode, run:

    ```shell
    make release
    ```

    To remove all intermediate build files, run:

    ```shell
    make clean
    ```
