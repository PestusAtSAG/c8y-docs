>**Important:** The **Event processing** functionality described here is only available if your tenant has Esper subscribed, not Apama. Apama is the standard CEP engine for new tenants. For tenants using Apama, similar functionality is available via the **Streaming Analytics EPL Apps** page, see [Developing apps with the Streaming Analytics application](/apama/analytics-introduction/#apama-epl-apps). If migrating, any CEL ({{< c8y-event-language >}}) code will need to be translated to EPL apps. For details on migration, see [Migrating from CEL (Esper) to Apama](/apama/overview-analytics/#migrate-from-esper) in the *Streaming Analytics guide*.

Using event processing, you can specify real-time business logic that is automatically run by {{< product-c8y-iot >}} as soon as new data arrives or existing data is modified. The logic is deployed in so-called "rules" which consist of a set of CEP statements.

>**Info:** A user-friendly way to specify real-time business logic is provided in the Cockpit application through the so-called "[Smart rules](/users-guide/cockpit#smart-rules)". Smart rules are "under the hood" also implemented as CEP statements, and you can see them in the **Event Processing** page. However, you cannot edit smart rules from here.  

Click **Event processing** in the **Business rules** menu to view all rules.

<br>For each rule in the list, the status (deployed = indicated by a green checkmark / not deployed = indicated by an exclamation mark), the name and the date when is was last updated is provided.

If the status of a rule is set to **Deployed**, you will see the output produced by the statement below the checkmark icon. Clicking a line of output unfolds the detailed output of the statement. Clicking **Clear all** removes the output from the screen.

#### To add a rule

1. Click **New rule** in the top menu bar.
2. Enter a name for the rule at the very top. You may only use alphanumeric characters without blanks.
3. By default, the status is set to **Deployed** which means that the statements you enter will be run immediately. Set the toggle to **Not deployed** if you want to avoid this.
4. Enter your CEP statements into the **Source code** textbox. For your convenience, we provide various examples. Click **Examples** and select an appropriate example from the dropdown list. Click **Append** to paste the example into the **Source code** textbox at the position of the cursor.
5. Click **Save** to save your settings.

The following example rule creates an alarm if the temperature goes below 0 degree.

#### To edit a rule

Simply click the row of the rule you want to edit or click the menu icon at the right of the respective row and then click **Edit**.

For details on the fields, see [To add a rule](#add-rule).


#### To delete a rule

Click the menu icon at the right of the respective row and then click **Delete**.

Instead of deleting the rule you can also disable it temporarily by setting its status to "Not deployed".
