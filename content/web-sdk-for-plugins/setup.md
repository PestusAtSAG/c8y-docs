### Prerequisites

Plugins are based on HTML5. You should be familiar with the following technologies:

* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/).


The following prerequisites are required to develop plugins and to execute the examples:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (6.7 or later)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (installed with Node.js)
* Access to your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} account, that means, you need your tenant ID, username and password.

### Cumulocity IoT CLI tool

Once all prerequisites are met, you are almost ready to build your own application and plugin.

For the process of developing a plugin (building, theming, translating and deploying your applications and plugins), the npm package "cumulocity-tools" must be installed globally on your machine. To install the npm package, execute the following command on your terminal.

```bash
$ npm i cumulocity-tools -g
```

Now you are ready to use the command line interface (CLI) tool. Try it out by executing the following command:

```bash
$ c8y --help
```

The "--help" option displays all available commands for the CLI tool.

### Cumulocity IoT UI package

As already described above, applications are always a collection of plugins. We provide a set of plugins you can build on in addition to your own. Prior to this, you must add a *package.json* file to the folder you will use for your application. To generate the *package.json* file automatically, simply run:

```bash
$ npm init
```

This command prompts you to enter values for several properties which will be included in the *package.json* file. The *package.json* file should include at least a name and version. To skip a property, press enter.

Then proceed to install the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} UI package containing the set of plugins by typing in the following command:

```bash
$ c8y install latest
```

This command will:

- Check for the latest version of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} UI package.
- Download the package.
- Add it as a dependency inside the *package.json* file.

Instead of "latest", you can also specify a certain version number, but this version must be the same or less than the backend version number.

> **Info:** When sharing your project, other developers only need to run  `npm install` inside the root folder of the application project, as the version of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} UI package is already defined as a dependency in the *package.json* file. You can always install other versions by running the `c8y install` command again.

> You can see the list of plugins which an application uses by utilizing the command `c8y util:showimports \[appContextPath\]`.
