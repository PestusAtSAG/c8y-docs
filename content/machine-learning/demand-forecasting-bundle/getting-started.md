We have added a *CONFIG.json* file to the attached ZIP file. This file is meant for capturing the tenant details and credentials which will be used by the demo scripts.

First of all, update the *CONFIG.json* with the appropriate values and save it. Replace `c_url` with your tenant URL, `c_user` with your tenant username and `c_pass` with your tenant password. Leave the `c_device_source` as is for now.

	CONFIG.json
	{
		c_url:https://yourtenant.{{< domain-c8y >}}
		c_user:user@company.com
		c_pass:password
		c_device_source:deviceID
	}
