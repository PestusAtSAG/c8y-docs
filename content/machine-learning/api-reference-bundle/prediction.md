### POST - Apply PMML model to multiple records

```
{{url}}/service/zementis/apply/{{model_name}}
```

Apply a PMML model to multiple records. This provides two kinds of operations. Generally, if a predictive model without binary type input is applied, this will be a batch 'apply' operation that streams multiple input records to Zementis microservice. Zementis microservice will automatically detect CSV (Comma Separated Value) or JSON records formatted input and stream results back in the same format unless otherwise specified in the Accept request header parameter with text/csv or application/json values. Compressing input data with ZIP will result in the same compression method for the returned output stream. In such a case, compression handling is implicit and the content within the compressed file (i.e. JSON or CSV) is handled via Accept request header parameter.

Note that if the records are specified in a file then the size of the uploaded file should not exceed 500 MB.

If a predictive model with a binary type input is applied, this will be a single 'apply' operation that processes a single binary source as input to Zementis Server.

Apply a PMML model group to multiple records. Note that the size of the uploaded file should not exceed 500 MB. If the operation is successful, the response will always be in 'application/zip' format whereas in case of errors it will be 'application/json'. Compressing input data with ZIP will result in the same compression method for the returned output stream.

### POST - Apply PMML model group to multiple records and show details

```
{{url}}/service/zementis/pmml/apply-group/{{group_name}}/detail
```

Apply a PMML model group to multiple records and show the details. Details include the computed outputs alongside the expected outputs if the expected outputs are part of the input data.
It also includes the information of the input record corresponding to the computed output.

Note that the size of the uploaded file should not exceed 500 MB. If the operation is successful, the response will always be in 'application/zip' format whereas in case of errors it will be 'application/json'. Compressing input data with ZIP will result in the same compression method for the returned output stream.

**ROLES & PERMISSIONS**: ROLE_MACHINE_LEARNING_READ or ROLE_MACHINE_LEARNING_ADMIN

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|{{auth}}
|Content-Type|required header parameter with two accepted values: application/octet-stream or multipart/form-data

|PARAMS||
|:---|:---|
|file (file)|data file in CSV with header format. Only applicable when Content-Type is multipart/form-data
|group_name (string)|required path variable for the name of the model group to be applied
|applyAllModels (boolean)|optional parameter used to specify if the data needs to be processed against all the models in the group and not just the primary model (default is false)
|matchScore (boolean)|optional parameter used to specify if score matching should be performed. If score matching is performed, the expected and actual outputs will be compared and a Match column will be added to the outputs (default is false)
|maxThreads|optional query parameter for specifying the maximum number of concurrent threads (default value is twice the number of processor cores)
|maxRecordsPerThread|optional query parameter for specifying the maximum number of records processed by a thread in batch (default value is 5000)

### POST - Apply ONNX model to multiple records

```
{{url}}/service/zementis/onnx/apply/{{model_name}}
```

Apply an ONNX model to multiple records. Note that the size of the uploaded file should not exceed 500 MB and the input should be in JSON format.

The ONNX format doesn't provide a representation for pre-processing steps. For deep learning models like CNN which deal with image data, the necessary pre-processing steps must be applied to the images and the result should be sent in JSON format as an input to the ONNX model.

>**Info:** An active subscription of the Onnx microservice is required to leverage this API.

|HEADERS||

### POST - Apply ONNX pipeline to input data

```
{{url}}/service/zementis/onnx/apply-pipeline/{{pipeline_name}}
```

Apply an ONNX pipeline to input data. Note that the size of the uploaded file should not exceed 500 MB.

The ONNX format doesn't provide a representation for pre-processing steps. For deep learning models like CNN which deal with image data, the necessary pre-processing steps must be applied to the images and the result should be sent in JSON format as an input to the ONNX model. In pipeline, the input data can be of any format as long as the pre-processing script of the pipeline can process it. However, if there is no pre-processing step in the pipeline then the input data must be in JSON format.
