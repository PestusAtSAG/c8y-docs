Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) provides a version-controlled project-based structure to organize all the data science resources including data, code, models, neural network architectures, inference pipelines, and training workflows.

Projects functionality includes:

* [Creating a new project](#creating-a-new-project)
* [Adding resources to the project - drag and drop, upload single or multiple files](#uploading-resources)
* [Committing a project - version management](#committing-a-project-version)
* [Switching between project versions](#switching-project-version)
* [Downloading a project as a compressed file](#downloading-a-project)
* [Uploading a project](#uploading-a-project)
* [Deleting a project](#deleting-a-project)

### Creating a new project

Click **Projects** in the navigator. This will list all the available projects.

### Uploading resources

Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) categorizes project resources as follows:

| Resource | Content description | File type |
|-----     |-----        |-----      |
| Data | Training data for Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) | <ul><li>csv</li><li>json</li><li>zip</li><li>png</li><li>jpg</li><li>txt</li></ul> |
| Code | Python code for data preparation/exploration, data pre/post-processing steps, model training and evaluation | <ul><li>py</li><li>ipynb</li></ul> |
| Model | Models trained by Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) | <ul><li>pmml</li><li>onnx</li></ul> |
| NN Designer | Architectures depicting complex structures of deep neural networks | <ul><li>architecture (JSON)</li></ul> |
| Inference Pipeline | Inference pipelines that define a sequence of pre-processing step, ONNX model, and post-processing step | <ul><li>pipeline (JSON)</li></ul> |
| Training Workflow | Training workflows that define a sequence of data preparation and model training/export activity that can be scheduled periodically | <ul><li>wf (JSON)</li></ul> |

To upload files, click the cloud upload icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-upload-icon.png" alt="Upload" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> and either click on the upload pane and select the files for uploading or use the drag and drop files capability.

### Committing a project version

To commit a project with its resources for versioning, click the plus icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-commit-add-icon.png" alt="Commit" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> at the top right and click **Commit Project**.

You can select all or a subset of resource files that need to be committed to a version. and click the submit icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-submit-icon.png" alt="Submit" style="display:inline-block; margin:0">.

![Commit version](/images/zementis/mlw-app-project-commit-select.png)

Click **Tasks** in the navigator and click the respective task name, which in this case will be the project name, to display the status of the commit process in the **Task History** section at the center.

The project card will show the different versions available for that project.

### Downloading a project

To download a specific version of a project, click the icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-hamburger-icon.png" alt="Hamburger" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> and click **Download**.

![Project download](/images/zementis/mlw-app-project-download.png)

Click **Tasks** in the navigator and click the respective task name, which in this case is the project name underscore download (ex. demoproject_download), to display the status of the download process in the **Task History** section at the center.

Once the task has reached **COMPLETED** status, the project ZIP would be successfully created. You can download the project ZIP by clicking on the **Project** button on the project card.

### Uploading a project

To facilitate collaboration and sharing, MLW allows you to upload the contents from an exported project archive.

To upload a project on a particular tenant, Click **+Add Project** at the right of the top menu bar, select the **Upload** radio button and upload the ZIP file by clicking on **Drop file here** button.

![Project upload](/images/zementis/mlw-app-project-upload.png)

Click **Tasks** in the navigator and click the respective task name, which in this case is the project name underscore unique uuid (ex. demoproject_a3n67e), to display the status of the upload process in the **Task History** section at the center.

Once the task has reached COMPLETED status, the new project card is successfully created. You can view the contents of the project by clicking the respective project card.
