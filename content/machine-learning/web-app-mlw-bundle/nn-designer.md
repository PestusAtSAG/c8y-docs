Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) provides an intuitive drag-and-drop designer that allows you to construct, edit, train and analyze deep neural networks. Built on the solid foundation of TensorFlow and Keras, the visual approach provides greater insight and clarity into the architecture of neural networks, enabling the creation of state-of-the-art deep learning models without writing a single line of code.

There are two approaches to training deep neural networks using Neural Network (NN) Designer. You can either start with a pre-trained model from a similar domain and use its architecture and weights as a starting point (transfer learning) or you can start from a blank slate and design a custom network from scratch. We will look at both these approaches in detail.

### Transfer learning

To begin the model training with transfer learning, you need to create a new neural network architecture file from an existing architecture.

The following steps illustrate how to train a deep neural network model using transfer learning.

#### Creating a new transfer learning architecture file

1. To create a new architecture file, click the add icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-new-automl-icon.png" alt="Add" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> and select **Add New Resource**.

2. In the **Add New Resource** dialog, select "NN Designer" as **Resource Type** and "MobileNet" as **Architecture**, enter a **Resource Name** and click **Submit**.

This will create a new architecture file with the extension **.architecture** in the **NN Designer** folder of the project.

#### Editing the architecture file

Select the architecture file in the **NN Designer** folder and click edit icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-edit-icon.png" alt="Edit" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> to edit the architecture.

This will open the MobileNet architecture in the editor where you can add new layers or remove existing layers.

With the pre-trained MobileNet model represented by the architecture shown above, you can initiate transfer learning. To get started, you must remove the last 2 layers: **Reshape** and **Activation**.

Next, drag and drop **Flatten** and **Dense** (Activation Function : softmax , Units : 2) layers, set the properties and connect them to the network.

Click the save icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-save-icon.png" alt="Save" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> at the right of the top menu bar to save the architecture.

#### Specifying the training process

1. Click the cogwheel icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-cogwheel-icon.png" alt="Cogwheel" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> to train a model on the updated architecture.  
2. In the **Training Parameters** section at the right, select the appropriate data under **Data**.
3. Specify the **Problem Type** which can either be "classification" or "regression".
4. If the data needs pre-processing, specify the **Pre Processing Script**.
5. The **Recurrence** parameter defines whether the training task needs to be executed one time or periodically. For this example, the training task will be one time.
6. Provide values for **Epoch**, **Learning Rate**, **Loss**, **Metrics**, **Optimizer**. Other parameters can be left as default.
7. Once the training parameters are updated click the submit icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-submit-icon.png" alt="Submit" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> which will trigger the training process.

Click **Tasks** in the navigator and click the corresponding task name, to display the status of the model training in the **Task History** section at the center.

Once the task is COMPLETED, the trained model will be saved in the **Model** folder of the respective **Project** in ONNX format.

### Custom architecture

To begin the model training with a custom architecture, you need to create a new neural network architecture file from scratch.

The following steps illustrate how to train a deep neural network model using custom architecture.

#### Creating a new custom architecture file

1. To create a new architecture file, click the add icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-new-automl-icon.png" alt="Add" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> and select **Add New Resource**.

2. In the **Add New Resource** dialog, select "NN Designer" as **Resource Type** and "None" as **Architecture**, and enter a **Resource Name** and click **Submit**.

This will create a empty architecture file with the extension **.architecture** in the **NN Designer** folder of the project.

#### Editing the architecture file

Select the architecture file and click edit icon <img src="/images/zementis/mlw-edit-icon.png" alt="Edit" style="display:inline-block; margin:0"> to edit the architecture.

This will open a blank architecture in the editor where you can add new layers to build a custom neural network architecture.

The rest of the steps to save the custom architecture and train the neural network model remains the same as in the case of transfer learning.
