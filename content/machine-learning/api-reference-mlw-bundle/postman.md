Graphical REST clients such as Postman are a convenient way to explore REST interfaces and the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} database content.

If you are already using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} API collection in Postman and the environment to access the collection for your tenant is set up, then you can directly import the MLW microservice collection (see below).

If you are doing a fresh set up of Postman for using the Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) microservice collection, first follow the steps described in [Using the REST interface > Overview > Using Postman](/microservice-sdk/rest#using-postman) in the *Microservice SDK guide*.

### Importing the Machine Learning Workbench (MLW) microservice collection into Postman

Import the APIs as a [JSON file](/files/zementis/MLWMicroserviceAPI.postman_collection.json).

Alternatively click: [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/754fbb177c426668c675)
 After importing, you will see a new collection "MLW Microservice API" in the **Collections** tab in Postman.
