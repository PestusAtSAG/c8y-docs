In the **Organization** page under **Administration**, you can customize the [**Machine Park Overview**](/oee/oee-dashboards/#machine-park). Various entities (that is, sites, areas and lines) can be created from here and can be arranged according to your needs.

The **Organization structure** area reflects the structure of the **Machine Park Overview**.

The entities listed in the **Unassigned entities** area, are not shown in the **Machine Park Overview** and no calculation is performed for them.

Click the arrow icon at the right to expand or collapse the entity and show or hide its details.
