This release of the Cumulocity IoT OEE App fixes important calculation issues and brings a set of UI improvements and enhancements for icons, dashboards, charts and the profile editor.

> **Important:** All OEE values and parameters calculated per calculation interval are now stored as fragments in one single measurement instead of 20 measurements. With this change, the number of measurements created by calculation interval is significantly reduced.
