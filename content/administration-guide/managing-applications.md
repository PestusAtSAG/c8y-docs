In the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform we distinguish between two kinds of applications:

* [Subscribed applications](#subscribed-applications) -  all applications subscribed to the tenant (either provided by the platform or a service provider) but not owned. May not be added, modified or removed by the user.
* [Own applications](#own-applications) - all applications owned by the tenant. Users can [add custom applications](#adding-applications) in various ways as own applications.

Click **Own applications** or **Subscribed applications** in the **Applications** menu in the navigator to display a list of all respective applications in your account.

Additionally, in {{< enterprise-tenant >}}s, it is possible to configure **Default subscriptions**, i.e. you can specify a list of applications that are subscribed by default to every new tenant on creation and/or to all existing tenants on platform upgrade. See [Default subscriptions](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#default-subscriptions) for more details.

### Application properties

Click on an application card to view the application properties.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-properties.png" alt="Application properties" style="max-width: 100%">

Each application will show the following properties, depending on the application type:

In case of applications of the type "microservice", you will additionally find information on its version, as well as on its isolation level and billing mode, see [{{< enterprise-tenant >}} > Managing tenants > Microservice usage](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#microservice-usage) for details on these parameters.  


<a name="subscribed-applications"></a>
### Subscribed applications

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides a variety of applications for different purposes.

Depending on your installation and/or optional services your tenant will show a selection of the potentially available applications listed below.

The columns show the following information:

* **Application**: Application name as visible in the Administration application.
* **Functionality**: Brief description.
* **Name**: Identification of the application in the API. In case you want to subscribe a tenant to the application using an API, use this string in the argument (as name).
* **Type**: Technical type of the application. "Feature" refers to built-in applications subscriptions, i.e. these applications are not represented by an explicit artefact (microservice or web application).

### Default applications

### Own applications

Own applications may be

* duplicates of subscribed applications (in order to be able to customize them)
* web-based UI applications, either deployed as standalone applications or as plugins deployed into a specific application (e.g. a widget to the Cockpit dashboard)
* server-side business logic deployed through microservices

Your applications are available through the application switcher in the top bar which allows to easily switch between applications.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-app-switcher.png" alt="App switcher">

You manage your applications under **Own applications**, accessible through the **Applications** menu.

In the **Own applications** page you will find a list of the applications available in your account.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-applications-own.png" alt="Own applications">

To display further information on the application, simply click its card. For details on the fields, refer to [Application properties](#application-properties).

To directly open an application from here, click **Open** on the respective application card.


<a name="adding-applications"></a>
#### To add an own application

Click **Add application** in the **Own applications** page.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-add.png" alt="Add application methods">

In the resulting dialog box, choose one of the following methods:

* [Upload web application](#uploading-zip-files) - by dropping a ZIP file or browsing for it on your computer.
* [Upload microservice](#uploading-microservices) - by dropping a ZIP file or browsing for it on your computer
* [External application](#external-application) - by linking to an application running elsewhere
* [Duplicate existing application](#clone-application) - by creating a copy of an existing application

<a name="uploading-zip-files"></a>
##### To upload a web application

1. Click **Add application** in the **Own applications** page.
2. Select **Upload web application**.
3. In the resulting dialog box, drop a ZIP file or browse for it on your computer.

The application is created once the ZIP file has been successfully uploaded.

>**Important:** The ZIP file must contain the *index.html* and *cumulocity.json* in its root directory, otherwise the application will not work.

<a name="uploading-microservices"></a>
##### To upload a microservice

1. Click **Add application** in the **Own applications** page.
2. Select **Upload microservice**.
3. In the resulting dialog box, drop a ZIP file or browse for it in your file system. Note that the size limit of the file to be uploaded is 500 MB.

<a name="clone-application"></a>
##### To duplicate an application

Duplicating an application might be useful if you want to customize a subscribed application according to your needs. Duplicating a subscribed application creates a copy of the application as an own application, with a link to the original application.

1. Click **Add application** in the **Own applications** page.
2. In the upcoming dialog, select **Duplicate existing application**.
3. Select the desired application from the dropdown list.
<br><br>
<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-duplicate.png" alt="Duplicate application">
<br><br>
4. In the next window, provide a name for the application. By default, the name of the original application is provided, extended by a number.
<br><br>
<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-duplicate-2.png" alt="Duplicate application">
<br><br>
5. Provide an application key, used to identify this application. By default, the key of the original application is provided, extended by a number.
6. Provide the application path as part of the URL to invoke the application. By default, the path of the original application is provided, extended by a number. If you set it to the path of the original subscribed application, your own application will overrule the subscribed application.
7. Finally, click **Duplicate** to create the application.

For details on the fields, see also [Application properties](#application-properties) below.

> **Info:** If you want your "own application" to overrule a subscribed standard application, the path of the "own application" needs to be set to the path of the original subscribed application.


<a name="editing-and-removing"></a>
#### To edit an own application

Simply click the application or click the menu icon at the right of an entry and then click **Edit**.

In the **Properties** tab, several fields can be modified, depending on the application type (see [Application properties](#application-properties)).

>**Important:** Never change the system application names (e.g. "Device Management", "Cockpit"). Otherwise, tenant initialization will fail.


#### To remove an own application

Click the menu icon at the right of an entry and then click **Remove**.

If you remove an application that overwrites a subscribed application, the currently subscribed application becomes available to all users. Additionally, the users will then also benefit from future upgrades of the subscribed application.

It is not possible to remove subscribed applications. This can only be done by the owner of the subscribed application.



#### Uploading archives

Multiple archive file versions can be stored in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} when they were created by uploading either a ZIP file or a MON file. Each version is called an archive. You can upload different versions at the same time and switch between these versions.

##### To upload an archive

1. Open the application by clicking on it.
2. Switch to the **Archives** tab.
3. Click **Upload archive** and browse for the archive on your computer or simply drop the archive file.
4. Click **Upload** to upload the archive to your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} account.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-archive.png" alt="Application archive">

Once uploaded, the recently uploaded version is automatically the active version, i.e. the version of the application that is currently being served to the users of your account. This version cannot be deleted.

> **Info:** The **Archive** tab is not available for subscribed applications, as only the owner of the application can perform this action.

##### To restore an older application version

Users can restore previous versions of an application from an archive.

1. Open the application by clicking on it.
2. Switch to the **Archives** tab.
3. Open the context menu for the desired version by clicking the menu icon and select **Set as active** to make it the active version.
4. Click **Remove** to remove the version from the archive.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-application-set-as-archive.png" alt="Application set as archive">

##### To reactivate a single application

If a hosted application is not deployed correctly, users may reactivate it.

1. Open the application by clicking on it.
2. Switch to the **Archives** tab.
3. Click **Reactivate** at the top right corner of the **Archives** tab.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-reactivate.png" alt="Refresh application">  

The selected application will be reactivated by removing the respective files from the application directory and unpacking the host application package again.

### Monitoring microservices

You can monitor microservices hosted by {{< product-c8y-iot >}} in two ways.

#### Status information

The status of the microservice can be checked on the **Status** tab of the respective application.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-microservice-status.png" alt="Microservice status" style="max-width: 100%">

The following information is provided on the **Status** tab:

* Instances: Number of active, unhealthy and desired microservice instances for the current tenant
* Subscribed tenants: Number of active, unhealthy and desired microservice instances for all subtenants subscribed to the microservice
* Alarms: Alarms for given application, provided in realtime
* Events: Events for given application, provided in realtime

The status information is available for subscribed applications as well as for own applications. Information on subscribed subtenants is only visible for the application owner.

To view the status you need the following permissions: ROLE&#95;APPLICATION&#95;MANAGEMENT&#95;READ and ROLE&#95;INVENTORY&#95;READ

##### Alarms and events

Most of the alarms and events visible in the **Status** tab are strictly technical descriptions of what's going on with the microservice.

There are two user-friendly alarm types:

* `c8y_Application_Down` - critical alarm which is created when no microservice instance is available
* `c8y_Application_Unhealthy` - minor alarm which is created when there is at least one microservice instance working properly, but not all of them are fully operating

User-friendly alarms are created for the microservice owner tenant only. They are also automatically cleared when the situation gets back to normal, i.e. all the microservice instances are working properly.

User-friendly alarms can be used to create smart rules. For details on creating smart rules of various types, see [Smart rules](/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules).

For example, to send an email, if a microservice is down, create an "On alarm send email" Smart Rule.

In the **On alarm matching** section, use `c8y_Application_Down` as an alarm type. As a target asset select the microservice which you would like to monitor, for example "echo-agent-server".

#### Log files

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers viewing logs which provide more details on the status of microservices.

To view logs, open the **Logs** tab of the respective microservice.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-applications-logs.png" alt="Microservice log" style="max-width: 100%">

At the top of the page, you can select the instance of the microservice, for which you want to view the logs.

> **Info:** If your microservice was re-scaled into two instances you should be able to switch between them, but it is not possible to see the logs from both instances at once.

Next to the instance dropdown you can select the time range for the log entries to be shown by selecting a date from the calendar and entering a time.

> **Info:** The time entered here may differ from the server time due to different time zones.

At the top right, additional functionality is provided:

* **Download** - To download the log data for a specified time range.
* **Dark theme** - To turn dark theme on or off.
* **Auto refresh** - To activate the auto refresh functionality. If activated, the displayed log data will automatically be refreshed every 10 seconds.
* **Unsubscribe** - To unsubscribe the microservice.
* **Delete** - To delete the microservice.

Initially, the **Logs** tab shows the latest logs of the microservice instance.

At the bottom right you find navigation buttons:

* **First** - directly navigates to the oldest available log entries for the microservice after its restart (maximum capacity 350MB of logs).
* **Previous** - increases the time range in 10 minutes steps.
* **Next** - reduces the time range in 10 minutes steps.
* **Last** - directly navigates to the latest available log entries.

If no logs are available in the selected time range, a message is shown accordingly:

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-microservice-no-logs.png" alt="Microservice log">

> **Info:** There is no possibility to see the logs from the previously running instances. However, inside the instance there is a Docker container running, and if only this one was restarted (not the whole instance) you should see the logs from the currently running and also lately terminated Docker container.

>Logs are always loaded from the Docker container using both `stdout` and `stderr` sources, and there is no possibility to distinguish/filter by the source.
